        <h1> SAM GIACOBETTI FINAL PORTFOLIO </h1>
        <h2>Week 1</h2>
        <p>In week one I created a GitHub account.I introduced my name on GitHub. I alsolearned how to create an Issue on course Issues!</p>

        <h2>Week 2</h2>
        <p>In week two I was introduced to Dance Party Hour of Code. I completed the hour of code and was awarded a cool certficiate! I also started to be introdued to coding through Artist lab where we made completed a code tutorial.  </p>

        <h2>Week 3</h2>
        <p>In week two we experimented with Scratch. I created a small game where a cat and a bear run into each other and then the background changes to a wetland. When they run into each other, the song "Happy birthday" begins to play. There is also broadcasting, as well as different costumes involved, for example the bear obtains a party hat throughout the game.  </p>

        <h2>Week 4</h2>
        <p>In week four we learned to code with Play Lab and App Lab on Code.org. In App Lab i created an adventure app that was a "Choose your own adventure game" where one may navigate through multiplescreen, choosing their paths and ultimately leading to their own epic adventure!
            The game I created consistes of 3 chachters, a dog, a dragon and a boy. The object of the game is to get the boy backto his dog without running into the dragon. If you hit the dragon you say "owch", if you get to the dog its "Youve won!" and your score goes up a point.

        <h4>Week 5</h4>
        <p>In week five I got to use the coding program Alice. Here i created a simple story with sea creatures. The dolphin talks about surfing, the animals interact, and then the orca says he smellsand swims away. The dolphin then follows him and the camera pans to their new location following the dolphin. All chachters turn, talk and move at some point in the story.  </p>

        <h4>Week 6</h4>
        <p>Week 6 was the start of our website. I created a homepage, an info page with a story and image, and a contact page.  </p>
        <img src="week6home.jpg" style=width:550px;height:450px;/>
        <img src="week6info.jpg" style=width:550px;height:450px;/>
        <img src="week6contact.jpg" style=width:550px;height:450px;/>

        <h2>Week 7</h2>
        <p>Week 7 we dove deeper intoweb coding. I learned about inline styles, using them on tags. I created an external style sheet. I also used class selectors for my tags and added a background image on my Info page. my pages now have highlighted text areas and look more official.  </p>
        <img src="week7home.jpg" style=width:550px;height:450px;/>
        <img src="week7info.jpg" style=width:550px;height:450px;/>
        <img src="week7contact.jpg" style=width:550px;height:450px;/>

        <h2>Week 8</h2>
        <p>Week 8 was intor to javascript. I made the name, email and terms of agreement required on the contact page, meaning that if the infor is not inserted correctly, the field turns red. I also created a simple math game. the game tracks how many answers are right and wrong and tells me if my answer is correct or not.</p>

        <img src="week8math.jpg" style=width:550px;height:450px;/>

        <h2>Week 9</h2>
        <p>Week 9 we played around with p5.js code editing software. I created a portrait of myself using shapes like circles, triangles, retangles and points.I aslo signed my name on the portrait.</p>
        <img src="week10.jpg" style=width:550px;height:450px;/>

        <h2>Week 10</h2>
        <p>Week 10 was upgrading our self portraits. I made two shapes(two circles) move back and forth along the x-axis and two along the y-axis. Each shape moved at a different speed. The title of my self portrait inceased and decreased in size and did this indefinatly forever. </p>

        <h2>Week 11</h2>
        <p>In Week 11 I made a spore-like game. This game has a moveable player and pbstavles. The obstacles are two circles that move around the screen in a random fashion. When one clicks the mouse, an elipse shaped obstacle appears on the screen.   </p>
        <img src="week11.jpg" style=width:550px;height:450px;/>

        <h2>Week 12</h2>
        <p>Week 12 I improved and adden onto my game. I still had a moveable player and and randomly moving obstacles (the two circles). An addition is I created a function that draws a circle onto the screen when one presses down on the mouse. There is a square exit that, when reached, the player ultimatly wins the game.  </p>
        <img src="week12.jpg" style=width:550px;height:450px;/>

        <h2>Week 13</h2>
        <p>Week we continued with our game. Everything stayed pretty much the same, except now there is a multitude of shpaes. When the game is run there is multi-colored dots that begin to pup up all over the game canvas. The mouse when clicked adds a non moving circle to the game board as well. The screenshot was hard to show the dots popping up because they are so fast and constntly moving, but I tried my best to capture them. The elipse also changes colors and the big moveable circle (the player) fuctuates in size. To give a visual, there are multicolored dots popping up randomly on the screen every second.  </p>
